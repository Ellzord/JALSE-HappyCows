## HappyCows

HappyCows is a [JALSE](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE) example project. It is a small simulation of cows in a field that randomly move and eat grass (which grows back over time). Below there are details about each of the classes and their function within the example (see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Ellzord/JALSE/wiki) for more information).
